Hey there, <br>
<br>
<!--I am dzikoysk, a Java developer from Poland and I have 4 years' experience in programming.<br>-->
I am hobbyist developer from Poland, programming for 4 years - mainly working with Java and JavaScript (ES6).<br>
<br>
I'm focused on performance, functionality and aesthetics. It's an integral part of my works.<br>
<br>
I love to create open source projects (like <a href="https://github.com/Panda-Programming-Language/Panda">Panda</a>).
You can follow me on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> if you want to see my activity.
